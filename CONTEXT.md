# Sleevy

Sleevy is the product name for a read-later app that saves web content from multiple entry points and returns to it with lightweight AI assistance.

## Language

**Saved Item**:
A user's saved relationship to a URL they may want to read, watch, or revisit later.
_Avoid_: Bookmark, pin, tab, article

**Link**:
A normalized web URL shared across Accounts for metadata and enrichment.
_Avoid_: Saved Item, user bookmark, per-account URL copy

**Link Metadata**:
Fetched descriptive data for a Link, such as title, image, favicon, canonical URL, and site name.
_Avoid_: AI enrichment, Saved Item metadata

**Link Author**:
The writer of what a Link points at, as a name, a handle, and an avatar address, stated by a provider rather than read from page markup. Known for a Post and absent for most other Links.
_Avoid_: Site Name, Account, Handle, byline text

**Link Enrichment**:
Generated or derived classification data for a Link, such as Type, Tag, Preview Summary, and Enrichment Status.
_Avoid_: Saved Item override, raw fetched metadata

**Read-Later App**:
A product centered on returning to captured content, with categorization and summarization as support features.
_Avoid_: Knowledge library, personal knowledge management system

**V1 Read-Later MVP**:
The first usable milestone that proves capture, enrichment, queue, library filters, and cross-client access.
_Avoid_: Production launch, public beta

**Sleevy**:
The product name for the V1 Read-Later MVP.

**Backend Core**:
The backend API project adapted from the existing bookmarks-core project.
_Avoid_: Separate core package, web app API routes as domain logic, throwaway prototype backend

**Hand-Written DTOs**:
Client transport models written as native Codable structs aligned with the API Contract.
_Avoid_: Hand-copied JSON models, generated full client

**REST API**:
The resource-style HTTP API exposed by the backend for iOS, web, share extension, and automation clients.

_Avoid_: AI enrichment, manual categorization

**AI Enrichment**:
Server-side Enrichment that uses an AI provider to generate a Preview Summary and Tag.
_Avoid_: On-device AI, manual categorization

**Extracted Page Content**:
The opening slice of a page's prose, without the site chrome, given to AI Enrichment so a Preview Summary and Tag can rest on what the page says. Taken from the head of the Readable Content when a Link has any.
_Avoid_: Reading text, scraped text, full text, Readable Content

**Readable Content**:
The article prose of a Link, extracted once and kept in two forms: the extractor's own article HTML, and the Markdown converted from it. The Reader View renders the Markdown; the HTML is kept only so a better conversion can be run later without re-fetching the page.

The client-side update where a newly saved item gains enriched metadata after initially appearing with minimal data, typically after refresh.
_Avoid_: Refresh, reload

**Type**:
A content kind assigned from hard rules, such as Video, Website, Article, Repository, or Post, where Website is the fallback.
_Avoid_: Category, user tag, folder

_Avoid_: Tweet, status, social link, Website

**Type Icon**:
A small visual indicator for a Saved Item's Type.
_Avoid_: Type chip, row badge text

**Tag**:
A subject area from the closed v1 vocabulary: AI, Tools, TypeScript, Security, Design, Backend, or Front-end.

_Avoid_: Bulk move endpoint, capture endpoint, tag update

**Folder Not Found**:
The HTTP 404 API response returned when an operation references a Folder that does not exist in the authenticated Account.

**Library**:
A complete browsing surface for Saved Items, with an unfiled root, Folder Views, and filters such as Type or Tag.
_Avoid_: Reading Queue, knowledge base

**Retrieval Surface**:
A browsing surface for finding previously saved content by filters, sorting, and search.
_Avoid_: Inbox, triage surface

**Retrieval Index**:
The canonical in-memory collection of Saved Items in the Native iOS App, keyed by identifier, with scope membership and Retrieval Coverage. Every Retrieval Surface derives its data from it.

An immutable projection of one retrieval request over the Retrieval Index: ordered Saved Items plus their Retrieval Coverage.
_Avoid_: Live query, view-owned filtering

**Retrieval Coverage**:
The explicit state of one retrieval scope: not requested, cached, loading, complete, failed, or stale. It keeps a known-empty scope distinct from a scope that has not loaded.
_Avoid_: Loading boolean, empty-array ambiguity

**Library Projection**:

**Unread Dot**:
A small dot that indicates a Saved Item has not been opened yet.
_Avoid_: Badge, bold unread row

**Unread Widget**:
The Home Screen and Lock Screen widget of the Native iOS App that shows the size of the Unread Backlog, or one Folder's share of it, with its newest Saved Items, and opens one on tap. It can also follow the Library, where it shows the newest Saved Items read or unread with the Unread Dot and the total number of saves. Which scope it follows is a widget setting; the default is the whole Inbox.
_Avoid_: Inbox widget, folder widget, library widget, badge count, reading activity widget

**Unread Backlog Snapshot**:
The copy of the Unread Backlog the app publishes into the app group for the Unread Widget: the count and newest items for the whole Inbox, for each Folder, and for the Library, the Folder list, and when it was published. The widget reads it and never calls the REST API itself.

The interaction on one Saved Item in the Unread Widget: the row leaves the widget, the read is written to the shared read-state queue for the app's next sync, and the Original URL opens directly without bringing the app forward.
_Avoid_: Widget deep link, open in app, background Open Action

**Delete Action**:
A simple destructive action that removes a Saved Item from the Account.
_Avoid_: Archive, trash, hide

_Avoid_: Raw URL, display URL

**Duplicate Save**:
A capture of a URL whose Normalized URL already belongs to an existing Saved Item.
_Avoid_: Duplicate item, copy

**Renewed Intent**:
A Duplicate Save of a read Saved Item that returns it to the unread Inbox.

_Avoid_: Per-item share, account privacy settings

**Published Folder**:
A Folder its Account chose to show on its Public Profile. Every Saved Item inside it is public while Profile Visibility is public, and a Folder is unpublished until its Account says otherwise.
_Avoid_: Private Folder, shared folder, public collection, hidden navigation destination

**Post Card**:
How a Public Profile shows a Saved Item whose Type is Post: the Link Author, then the message at reading size with its own line breaks kept. It carries no Preview Summary, because the message is already the words the reader came for.
_Avoid_: Embed, platform widget, quote block, headline

**Link Card**:
How a Public Profile shows every other Saved Item: the title first, because there a title is a headline for something else, with the Preview Summary under it and the image beside it.
_Avoid_: Row, list item, tile

**Reading Activity**:
Per-day counts of first captures for an Account, shown on a Public Profile as a rolling 52-week grid.

_Avoid_: API Key Rate Limit, per-endpoint quota, per-Account budget

**Render Token**:
The secret the web server states to identify a request as its own render of a public page rather than a call from a public API client. A stated Render Token takes no Public Profile Rate Limit budget, so a visitor who opens a page always gets the page.
_Avoid_: API Key, session token, bearer credential, CF-Connecting-IP

**Search Indexability**:
The server-computed boolean that tells a client whether a Public Profile may be offered to search engines.
_Avoid_: Client-side robots rule, per-page meta decision, sitemap flag

**Demo Mode**:
The state the iOS app runs in when it is launched for marketing capture: a fabricated Account, its Saved Items, Folders, and Public Profile, all served in memory. The API is never called, so a capture shows no real reader's library. Switched on per launch, never by a build setting or a user-facing control.
_Avoid_: Test mode, mock mode, staging account, seed data, fixtures

**Capture Screen**:
The screen a Demo Mode launch opens on, named per launch so one App Store screenshot is one launch instead of a scripted sequence of taps.
_Avoid_: Deep link, route argument, UI test step

## Relationships

- A **Read-Later App** contains many **Saved Items**.
- A **Link** may be referenced by many **Saved Items** across Accounts.
- A **Saved Item** belongs to one **Account** and references one **Link**.
- A **Saved Item** optionally references one **Source**.
- A **Source** belongs to one **Account** and is unique by name within that Account.
- An **Account** may have many **Sources**.
- A **Source** is lazily registered by the API when a capture includes a `sourceName` not yet known for the Account.
- A **Link** has shared **Link Metadata** and **Link Enrichment**.
- The **V1 Read-Later MVP** includes native iOS, backend API, web companion, and shared API contract projects.
- **Demo Mode** replaces the Account, its **Saved Items**, its **Folders**, and its **Public Profile**; every other behaviour stays the real one.
- A **Capture Screen** names one screen of the signed-in shell and is only read while **Demo Mode** is on.
- The monorepo uses five **App Workspaces**: `apps/api`, `apps/web`, `apps/ios`, `apps/chrome-extension`, and `apps/raycast-plugin`.
- The backend API should be the **Backend Core**, adapted from bookmarks-core, rather than a separate core package plus API wrapper.
- The API uses Postgres through Drizzle for v1 deployment on a single VPS.
- The **API Contract** is generated from Effect route and schema definitions.
- The **REST API** is the client-facing shape of the **API Contract**.
- Product apps and authorized API clients use shared **Folder Endpoints**, with permitted operations determined by authentication and granted **API Key Scopes**.
- Folder records are managed through `GET /v1/folders`, `POST /v1/folders`, `PATCH /v1/folders/{id}`, and `DELETE /v1/folders/{id}`.
- The **Folder Assignment Endpoint** accepts a Folder identifier or `null` for **No Folder**.
- `GET /v1/saved-items` accepts an optional **Folder Selector**: omit it for the complete Library, pass a Folder identifier for a **Folder View**, or pass `none` for **No Folder**.
- The **API Reference** is public and lives at `/docs` in the Web Companion app, while the OpenAPI JSON remains generated by the API project.
- The API implements the **REST API** with **Effect HttpApi**.
- iOS uses **Hand-Written DTOs** with a hand-written API client.
- The public API and adapted backend domain use **Saved Item** terminology rather than bookmark terminology.
- The **Native iOS App** is a primary surface for the **Inbox** and **Library**.
- The **Inbox** contains unread **Saved Items** for quick triage, while the **Library** contains the complete saved collection for browsing and filtering.
- The **Library** is the primary **Retrieval Surface** for the complete saved collection.
- A **Folder View** is a Library navigation destination, while **Type** and **Tag** remain filters within Library browsing.
- A **Folder View** contains both read and unread **Saved Items** and does not remove items when they become read.
- The **Home Tab** is the iOS tab label for the **Inbox**, whose screen title is "Inbox".
- The **Home Tab** uses an **Unread-Only Inbox** behavior.
- The **Home Tab** shows the full **Unread Backlog**, not a capped preview.
- The **Home Tab** surfaces the **Unread Backlog** count as lightweight navigation context.
- The **Home Tab** shows **All Caught Up** when the **Unread Backlog** is empty.
- The **Unread Widget** shows the **Unread Backlog** count and its newest **Saved Items**, for the whole **Inbox** or one **Folder**, from the **Unread Backlog Snapshot**, which the **Native iOS App** publishes each time the **Inbox** or the **Folder** list changes and clears on sign-out.
- A **Widget Row Tap** marks the **Saved Item** read through the shared read-state queue and opens its **Original URL** directly; the **Native iOS App** sends the **Read State** to the REST API on its next sync. A tap on the widget's count panel is a **Deep Link** to the **Inbox** or the **Folder View**.
- The **Home Tab** keeps **Clipboard Capture** in v1 because new captures enter the unread triage flow.
- A **Duplicate Save** of a read **Saved Item** expresses **Renewed Intent** and returns that item to the **Home Tab** as unread.
- The **Home Tab** supports manual **Read State** changes as secondary triage actions.
- The **Native iOS App** keeps a separate **Search Tab** because search is an idiomatic native tab role, while **Library** remains the browsing and filtering retrieval surface.
- The **Search Tab** retrieves Saved Items across all Folders and unfiled Library content.
- The **Native iOS App** is implemented as a **SwiftUI App** in v1.
- The **Native iOS App** should leave room for **Native Motion**, including Metal shader effects.
- **Enrichment Loading Motion** is the v1 use case for Metal shader effects.
- The **Web Companion** is the keyboard-driven desktop client for **Manual URL Capture**, **API Key Settings**, and managing Saved Items with list navigation, single-key actions, and a **Command Palette**.
- The **Web Companion** supports dragging an individual **Saved Item** onto a **Folder** and also exposes a non-drag **Move to Folder Action**.
- The **Web Companion** presents user-created **Folders** as visible Library navigation destinations suitable for drag-and-drop targets and shows unfiled Saved Items on `/library`.
- The **Web Companion** represents Folder navigation with **Web Folder Routes**, leaving query state available for sorting or filtering within a Folder View.
- The **Web Companion** creates Folders from the Library sidebar and exposes rename and delete through a Folder contextual menu.
- The **Web Companion** shows its Library sidebar as a standing column on a wide viewport and as a **Sidebar Sheet** — an off-canvas panel opened from a floating menu button — on a narrow one, with the same rows in both.
- V1 has one **Account** per Google email.
- Any Google email may create an **Account** in v1.
- An **Account** owns a private collection of **Saved Items**.
- An **App Session** authenticates the web app for an **Account**.
- **Prototype Auth** may be used before production **App Session** setup.
- An **API Key** authenticates external systems and non-interactive clients for an **Account**.
- **API Key** support is part of v1.
- An **Account** may have many **API Keys**.
- **API Key Settings** creates, displays, and revokes **API Keys** for an **Account** in the **Web Companion** only.
- V1 **API Keys** use fixed **API Key Scopes** to permit only granted REST API actions.
- The v1 **API Key Scope** vocabulary includes `saved-items:capture`, `saved-items:read`, `saved-items:write`, `saved-items:delete`, `folders:read`, `folders:write`, `folders:delete`, and `account:read`.
- An API Key with **Folder Read Access** may list existing **Folders** for configuring capture-time filing.
- A `folders:read` API response exposes each **Folder** identifier and name only, without Saved Item counts.
- An API Key with **Folder Write Access** may create and rename **Folders**.
- An API Key with **Folder Delete Access** may perform a **Delete Folder Action**.
- An API Key with `saved-items:capture` may assign a known existing **Folder** during capture without also holding **Folder Read Access**.
- An API Key with `saved-items:write` may perform a **Move to Folder Action** for an existing **Saved Item**.
- The v1 **REST API** does not expose account administration through **API Keys**.
- Each **API Key** is subject to an **API Key Rate Limit**.
- The v1 **API Key Rate Limit** applies uniformly to all REST API routes rather than using route-specific budgets.
- The v1 **API Key Rate Limit** applies only to API-key-authenticated requests, not **App Session** requests.
- The v1 **API Key Rate Limit** is 20 requests per minute per **API Key**.
- A request over the **API Key Rate Limit** receives a **Rate Limit Response** with HTTP 429, `Retry-After`, and rate-limit headers.
- A **Link** retains **Saved Metadata** and, when extraction succeeds, **Readable Content**. It never retains a copy of the page itself: no assets, no archive, no offline bundle (see ADR 0021).
- **Readable Content** is stored as article HTML and as Markdown, is shared per **Link** like the rest of Enrichment, and each form is capped at a fixed size. Both forms are always present: they are produced by one extraction or not at all.
- The **Reader View** renders the Markdown form. The HTML form is stored and never served, so no client sanitizes third-party markup in v1.
- **Readable Content** is never included in a Saved Item list response and never appears on a **Public Profile**.
- A **Saved Item** response states only whether its **Link** has **Readable Content**, from a flag on **Link Enrichment**, so a list read never touches the stored body.
- **Readable Content** is read through its own request, never as part of retrieval.
- **Saved Metadata** is separated into **Link Metadata** and **Link Enrichment** so fetched page data and generated classification can evolve independently.
- A **Saved Item** retains user-specific state such as read state, last saved time, and overrides.
- A **Saved Item** may have **Saved Item Tags** supplied by API clients or other capture surfaces.
- A **Folder** is owned by one **Account** and organizes that Account's **Saved Items** independently of **Tags**.
- Folders are flat in v1 and do not contain child Folders.
- Folder names are unique within an **Account** after trimming surrounding whitespace and comparing case-insensitively.
- Folder names are trimmed before storage, must contain at least one non-whitespace character, and may be at most 80 characters long.
- Renaming a **Folder** to a conflicting name is rejected and does not merge Folders.
- A conflicting Folder create or rename returns a **Folder Name Conflict**.
- A blank or over-80-character Folder name returns an **Invalid Folder Name** response.
- User-created **Folders** are presented alphabetically in v1, while unfiled items appear on the Library root without a named **No Folder** destination.
- A **Saved Item** belongs to zero or one **Folder**.
- A Saved Item REST representation always includes `folder`, containing a **Folder Summary** when assigned and `null` for **No Folder**.
- Signed-in product apps use an **App Session** to manage **Folders**; API clients may list, create, rename, or delete Folders only when granted the corresponding Folder scopes.
- API clients may assign captures to an existing **Folder** when they know its stable identifier.
- API clients with `saved-items:write` may move existing **Saved Items** into a **Folder** or into **No Folder**.
- Operations that reference a missing, deleted, or other-Account Folder fail with **Folder Not Found**, including capture assignment, membership updates, folder mutation, and Folder View retrieval.
- A **Delete Folder Action** makes contained **Saved Items** unfoldered rather than deleting them.
- Product app confirmation UI for a **Delete Folder Action** must state that Saved Items are kept.
- Product app confirmation UI for a **Delete Folder Action** does not warn about possible external API client configuration.
- Product apps and API clients authorized with `saved-items:write` may perform a **Move to Folder Action** for individual **Saved Items** in v1.
- Shared **Saved Metadata** should not be duplicated per **Account**.
- Saved Item list rows show title with a **Domain Subtitle**.
- **Saved Metadata** may include a **Preview Summary**.
- Saved Item list rows use **Stable Row Height**, showing **Preview Summary** when available without changing row rhythm.
- **Saved Metadata** may include an **External Image URL** loaded directly by iOS and web clients.
- **Extracted Page Content** is not persisted; it is derived per **Enrichment Job** from the **Readable Content** when there is any, and from the fetched page directly when there is not.
- **Readable Content** is produced by a best-effort **Enrichment Job** stage that skips rather than fails, so a **Link** that yields no prose stays exactly as usable as one saved before the Reader View existed.
- A **Link** whose **Type** is not an article normally yields no **Readable Content**, because the extraction check rejects it rather than a rule about **Type** excluding it.
- Extraction is two passes: a cheap check decides whether the page is readable, and only then is the body extracted. A rejected page stores nothing at all, rather than storing a body and marking it absent.
- A page below the extractor's character floor yields no **Readable Content**, so a thin page produces nothing rather than producing a fragment.
- Extraction is bounded by a node-count limit, because **Enrichment** runs against URLs anyone may submit.
- Extraction always runs locally, against whatever markup the fetch produced. Where a page needs a browser to yield markup at all, the fetch has already used one, so a page blocked from the origin host is extracted exactly like one that was not.
- **Readable Content** is stored with a search index over the prose of its Markdown form from the start — link targets and bare URLs are stripped before indexing, so a target is never a search term — but neither the **Search Tab** nor the **Command Palette** reads it in v1. The HTML form is never indexed.
- A **Preview Summary** conveys what the page says. It never describes the page as an object, and it is absent rather than filler when the page yields nothing to say.
- A **Link** may later receive AI-generated categorization and summarization.
- A **Saved Item** records which **Capture Channel** created it.
- A **Capture Channel** creates **Saved Items** through **One-Tap Capture**.
- The **Capture Endpoint** is exposed as `POST /v1/captures`.
- The **Capture Endpoint** returns the current **Saved Item** before asynchronous **Enrichment** finishes.
- The **Capture Endpoint** returns a **Capture Result** of created or updated.
- Capture is a behavior that creates or updates a **Saved Item**, not a separate persisted domain object in v1.
- The **iOS Share Extension** is the preferred iPhone **Capture Channel**.
- The **iOS Share Extension** saves into the signed-in **Account**.
- The **iOS Share Extension** saves and dismisses without capture-time filing UI.
- Ordinary first-party **One-Tap Capture** flows do not prompt for a **Folder** in v1.
- The **Chrome Extension** is a **Capture Channel** that saves the active tab URL.
- The **Chrome Extension** uses **One-Tap Capture** with no popup UI in the happy path.
- The **Chrome Extension** authenticates via an **API Key** configured in its options page.
- The **Chrome Extension** shows badge feedback for save results.
- The **Chrome Extension** redirects to its options page when no **API Key** is set.
- **Manual URL Capture** is a minimal paste-and-save UI in the web companion and native iOS app.
- **Clipboard Capture** is the preferred in-app **Manual URL Capture** entry point for the **Native iOS App**.
- **Clipboard Capture** shows a **Clipboard URL Preview** before saving a clipboard URL.
- **Clipboard Capture** requires explicit confirmation before saving a clipboard URL.
- **Clipboard Capture** opens empty **Manual URL Capture** when the clipboard does not contain a URL.
- **Clipboard URL Preview** is lightweight and on-device; backend **Enrichment** still happens only after capture.
- **Capture Capsule** is opened and closed by the same navigation action, which morphs between add and close states.
- **Capture Capsule** appears inline at the top of the **Inbox** and should not shift the navigation title, toolbar, or tab chrome.
- **Capture Capsule** uses one subtle editable URL field for both clipboard preview and manual entry.
- **Capture Capsule** follows the **Capture Endpoint** definition of a valid URL rather than introducing stricter client-only URL rules.
- **Capture Capsule** may disable saving for obviously empty or locally unparseable input, while the **Capture Endpoint** remains the final URL validation authority.
- **Capture Capsule** remains visible and locked while save confirmation is in flight.
- **Capture Capsule** collapses after successful capture and the Saved Item appears at the top of the **Inbox**.
- **Capture Capsule** keeps the entered URL visible with a compact inline error when capture fails.
- **Capture Capsule** creates a **Pending Capture** when the API is temporarily unavailable.
- The **iOS Share Extension** creates a **Pending Capture** when the API is temporarily unavailable.
- A **Pending Capture** appears in the **Inbox** until it syncs.
- **Pending Capture** sync uses the same native iOS behavior for **iOS Share Extension** and **Capture Capsule**.
- **Capture Capsule** collapses once a URL is accepted as a **Pending Capture**.
- A **Duplicate Save** moves the existing **Saved Item** to the top of the **Inbox**.
- A **Duplicate Save** does not create another **Saved Item**.
- A **Duplicate Save** sets the existing **Saved Item** to unread.
- A **Duplicate Save** updates the **Source** and **Capture Channel** to the latest capture.
- A **Duplicate Save** is detected per **Account** using **Normalized URL**.
- **Last Saved At** drives newest-first ordering for **Saved Items**.
- **Enrichment** happens after a **Saved Item** has already been saved.
- **Hard Metadata** may be collected during capture and does not require **AI Enrichment**.
- **AI Enrichment** is owned by the backend in v1.
- **Enrichment** runs through an **Enrichment Job**, not inside the save request.
- **Enrichment** is shared per **Link** rather than duplicated per **Account**.
- Clients see **Enrichment Status**, not detailed **Enrichment Job** stages.
- **Enrichment** may assign a **Type** and **Enrichment Tags** to a **Link**.
- **Type** is assigned by hard rules in v1, not by **AI Enrichment**.
- **Enrichment Tags** are chosen by **AI Enrichment** in v1 without hard-rule hints.
- **AI Enrichment** asks for **Enrichment Tags** and the **Preview Summary** in one request, so the **Extracted Page Content** is sent once. The tagging and preview-summary stages of the **Enrichment Job** report on that one request: they fail together, and each is skipped on its own when the provider returns nothing for it.
- **Type** is assigned with **Hard Metadata** during capture rather than waiting for an **Enrichment Job**.
- Saved Item list rows may show a calm **Type Icon** for the **Type**.
- A newly captured **Saved Item** appears immediately and later receives **Hydration** as **Enrichment** completes.
- If **Enrichment** fails, the **Saved Item** remains usable through a **Basic Link**.
- V1 UI does not show a visible error for failed **Enrichment Status**.
- A **Link** has at most one **Type**.
- A **Link** may have multiple **Tags** in v1.
- The API and persistence model should expose **Type** as a singular value and **Tags** as an array in v1.
- A **Link** always has a **Type** after capture.
- **Website** is the fallback **Type** when hard rules do not identify a more specific content kind.
- The v1 **Type** hard rules are intentionally simple: GitHub or GitLab URLs are Repository, YouTube, youtu.be, or Vimeo URLs are Video, URLs containing "blog" or "article" are Article, and everything else is Website.
- A **Link** may have no **Enrichment Tags** when none are confidently extracted.
- A **Link** has no **Enrichment Tags** when **AI Enrichment** is unavailable or disabled.
- **Tags** must come from a closed app-defined vocabulary in v1.
- The v1 **Tag** vocabulary is developer-oriented because the first Library use case is saving development-heavy material.
- The v1 **Tag** vocabulary is: AI, Tools, TypeScript, Security, Design, Backend, and Front-end.
- When multiple **Enrichment Tags** could apply, **AI Enrichment** chooses all that match the user's likely retrieval intent.
- **Saved Item Tags** are hard data for one Account's Saved Item and do not alter shared **Link Enrichment**.
- API clients may provide **Saved Item Tags** during capture.
- Explicitly configured API clients may provide a **Folder** assignment during capture.
- A Duplicate Save with **Saved Item Tags** updates the existing Saved Item's Tags.
- A Duplicate Save without **Saved Item Tags** preserves any existing Saved Item Tags.
- A Duplicate Save with a **Folder** assignment moves the existing **Saved Item** into that Folder.
- A Duplicate Save without a Folder identifier moves the existing **Saved Item** into **No Folder**.
- Clients receive **Effective Tags** as `tags` in the REST API.
- The **Inbox** presents unread **Saved Items** in reverse capture order.
- The **Library** provides browsing across unfiled Saved Items and **Folder Views** with filtering and categorization controls.
- The **V1 Library** reuses Saved Item list UI for its root and **Folder Views**, with **Type** and **Tag** filters.
- The **V1 Library** supports at most one active **Type** filter and one active **Tag** filter.
- The **V1 Library** may include a **No Tag Filter** for Saved Items without any **Tags**.
- The Library root in product apps shows Saved Items in the **No Folder Filter** state without requiring a visible **No Folder** navigation destination.
- V1 does not include a general manual tag editor outside capture-time **Saved Item Tags**.
- The **Native iOS App** has a **Home Tab**, **Library Tab**, and **Search Tab** in v1.
- The **Native iOS App** exposes the **Move to Folder Action** through native item interaction, allowing a Saved Item to return to the Library root without presenting **No Folder** as a named navigation destination.
- The **Native iOS App** navigates into a **Folder View** rather than representing Folders only inside the filter sheet.
- Selecting a **Folder** in the **Native iOS App** pushes a native Folder View on the Library navigation stack, keeping the Library overview as the root.
- The **Native iOS App** presents Folders in a horizontally scrollable Library section, shows Saved Items without a Folder beneath that section on the Library root, and exposes rename and delete through native Folder context menus.
- The iOS Library root list contains only Saved Items without a Folder; filed items appear in their Folder Views rather than being duplicated below the Folder row.
- V1 retrieval uses **V1 Library** filters rather than text search.
- The **Native iOS App** supports **Cached Viewing** and **Pending Capture** for native iOS capture flows in v1.
- The **Reading List Store** serves every Native iOS **Retrieval Surface** through **Retrieval Snapshots** and **Library Projections** derived from one **Retrieval Index**.
- **Cached Viewing** restores the **Retrieval Index** from a versioned per-Account cache before network refresh.
- V1 does not include reminders or push notifications.
- Each **Saved Item** has a **Read State**.
- **Unread Dot** is the v1 visual indicator for unread **Read State**.
- A **Saved Item** becomes read when the user opens it.
- Opening a **Saved Item** that has **Readable Content** opens the **Reader View**; opening one without it sends the user to its **Original URL** in the browser.
- The **Reader View** always offers the **Original URL**, because extraction loses tables, embeds, and figure captions.
- Clients may open the known **Original URL** immediately while asynchronously notifying the API to update **Read State**.
- The **Open Action** is exposed as `POST /v1/saved-items/{id}/open`.
- A **Delete Action** removes a **Saved Item** without archive or trash behavior in v1.
- The **Reader View** is the only Saved Item destination; list rows remain the primary item surface for everything else.
- The **Reader View** loads **Readable Content** from its own request, so opening one item never changes what a list read costs.
- The **Command Palette** searches Saved Items by title and host, surfaces page navigation and action commands, and detects pasted URLs to offer capture.
- The **Command Palette** searches Saved Items across all Folders and unfiled Library content.
- The **Command Palette** suppresses all global keyboard shortcuts while open and restores list selection state on close.
- The **Web Companion** uses app-level selection state in a root-level React context rather than DOM focus for keyboard list navigation.
- An **Account** has at most one **Public Profile**.
- "Profile", alone, in code and in API paths, always names the **Public Profile** record — its **Handle** and its **Profile Visibility**. It never names an **Account**, which is why `/v1/profile` reads and changes those two settings and nothing else about the Account.
- A **Public Profile** is addressed by one **Handle** at `/u/{handle}`.
- A **Handle** is unique across Accounts after lowercasing, is 3 to 30 characters of `a-z`, `0-9`, `-`, and `_`, and may not use a reserved path name.
- A **Handle** stays reserved to its Account while **Profile Visibility** is private. Renaming releases the old spelling at once, and anyone may claim it. Deleting the Account releases the Handle.
- **Profile Visibility** is private by default and becomes public through one explicit confirmed action.
- A **Saved Item** appears on a **Public Profile** only when Profile Visibility is public and the Saved Item is in a **Published Folder**.
- A **Saved Item** in no Folder is never public, so a capture that files nothing publishes nothing.
- A Saved Item outside a **Published Folder** is absent from a Public Profile without a placeholder or a count.
- Publishing and unpublishing a **Folder** takes effect at once, so unpublishing is how an Account withdraws content.
- A **Public Profile** withholds the Folder name, **Source** name, **Capture Channel**, and **Read State** of every listed Saved Item.
- A **Public Profile** shows a **Handle** only, without a display name, biography, or avatar. The **Link Author** of a **Post** is a property of the Link, not of the Account, and is shown.
- A **Public Profile** shows a Saved Item whose **Type** is **Post** as a **Post Card**, and every other Saved Item as a **Link Card**.
- A **Post** is served as markup the Public Profile itself renders, never as a platform embed, so a crawler reads the same words a visitor does.
- **Link Enrichment** writes no **Preview Summary** for a **Post**, because the message is already what the reader came for. A Post is still tagged.
- **Reading Activity** counts first captures only, bucketed by Saved Item creation time in UTC, and counts every Saved Item, including those outside a **Published Folder**.
- **Reading Activity** covers a rolling 52 weeks ending on the current UTC day.
- A **Duplicate Save** adds no **Reading Activity**.
- A **Public Profile** becomes eligible for search indexing when its Account is at least 7 days old and has at least 5 public Saved Items.
- A **Public Profile** marks every outbound Saved Item link `rel="ugc nofollow"`.
- A request that states the **Render Token** is the web server rendering a public page, and takes no **Public Profile Rate Limit** budget. A request without it, or with a wrong one, is a public API client and is counted.
- What bounds the render path is the edge cache on the Public Profile page, not a budget on the **Public Profile Endpoints** behind it.
- A request for an unknown **Handle** and a request for a private **Public Profile** return the same not-found response.
- Every **Public Profile Endpoint** lives under `/v1/public/`, beginning with `GET /v1/public/profiles/{handle}`.
- A **Public Profile Endpoint** requires no **App Session** and no **API Key**.
- `GET /v1/public/profiles/{handle}` returns the **Handle**, the Account join date, the public Saved Item count, and **Search Indexability**.
- `GET /v1/public/profiles/{handle}/activity` returns the **Handle**, the inclusive first and last UTC day of the **Reading Activity** window, and one count for every day inside it that has a save.
- The Account join date on a **Public Profile** is when the **Account** was created, not when its **Handle** was claimed.
- `GET /v1/public/profiles/{handle}/saved-items` returns one page of that Account's public **Saved Items**, newest first by Saved Item creation time, 50 to a page.
- A public Saved Item page is addressed by page number, and page 1 answers even when an Account publishes nothing, so every page of a **Public Profile** is a URL a crawler can reach.
- A public Saved Item representation carries the **Original URL**, host, title, favicon variants, image, **Type**, **Effective Tags**, **Preview Summary**, and the Saved Item creation time, and nothing else.
- **Search Indexability** is true only when the **Account** is at least 7 days old and has at least 5 public **Saved Items**.
- `GET /v1/public/indexable-profiles` returns one page of the **Handles** whose **Public Profile** has **Search Indexability**, 1000 to a page, each with the creation time of the newest **Saved Item** that Public Profile shows.
- A **Public Profile** without **Search Indexability** is absent from `GET /v1/public/indexable-profiles`, and the route answers with an empty page rather than a not-found when no Handle qualifies.
- The **Web Companion** serves `/sitemap.xml` from that listing together with its own fixed marketing and documentation URLs, and serves the fixed URLs alone when the listing cannot be read.
- Every **Public Profile Endpoint** is subject to the **Public Profile Rate Limit** rather than the **API Key Rate Limit**.
- A request over the **Public Profile Rate Limit** receives a **Rate Limit Response**.
- A successful **Public Profile Endpoint** response may be cached for five minutes; a not-found response is not cached.
- The public **Saved Item** rule is resolved in SQL and owned by Postgres, which decides the one-hour boundary.
- A signed-in visitor may capture a listed Saved Item into their own Account through the `public-profile` **Capture Channel**.
- Marking a Saved Item or a Folder private is a **Web Companion** or **Native iOS App** action in v1.

## Flagged Ambiguities

These record the reasoning behind decisions that are not obvious from the definitions alone.

- `CapturedLink` from bookmarks-core should be removed for v1; resolved: capture does not need its own persisted domain record.
- iOS is the primary mobile client; the Web Companion is the primary desktop client with its own keyboard-first interaction model (see ADR 0010).
- The **Web Companion** should be separate from the API project; resolved: keep UI framework concerns out of the Effect backend.
- Defer Sign in with Apple until native distribution is production-worthy; use **Prototype Auth** during early validation.
- **Type** should not depend on AI in v1; resolved: use hard rules for type and AI only for tag and preview summary.
- **Enrichment Tags** should not have a non-AI fallback in v1; resolved: no AI means no Enrichment Tags unless the Saved Item has **Saved Item Tags**.
- "category" was too broad; resolved: use **Type** for content kind and **Tag** for subject area.
- AI should not invent arbitrary type or tag names per item; types and tags come from small app-defined fixed sets.
- "unknown" should not be a user-facing **Type**; resolved: use **Website** as the successful fallback instead.
- Tags are not arbitrary user-managed labels; resolved: changing the tag vocabulary is a product change.
- `generatedTags` as an array was considered but rejected for singular tag; resolved: use array `tags` after product decision.
- `generated_type` and `generated_tag` overstate implementation details in storage and API contracts; resolved: use `type` and `tags`.
- Enrichment should not be duplicated for every Account; resolved: shared **Link** records own enrichment metadata, while **Saved Items** own user-specific state and overrides.
- Capture-time organization should not mutate shared **Link Enrichment**; resolved: store capture-supplied Tags as **Saved Item Tags** on the Account's Saved Item.
- **Folders** are not **Tags**; resolved: Folders are user-created containers for deliberate organization, while Tags remain subject-based filters.
- A **Saved Item** cannot belong to multiple **Folders**; resolved: a Folder is an optional single location, while Tags provide overlapping organization.
- Duplicate capture does not preserve Folder membership by omission; superseded: capture treats a Folder identifier as the desired destination and otherwise moves the Saved Item into **No Folder**.
- A requested **Folder** is not best-effort; resolved: missing or inaccessible folder identifiers return HTTP 404 across capture, membership, management, and Folder View retrieval rather than disclosing ownership or silently using **No Folder**.
- Folder membership is **Saved Item** state; resolved: API clients with `saved-items:write` may perform a **Move to Folder Action**, while capture-only clients may file only during capture.
- Folder membership updates use `PUT /v1/saved-items/{id}/folder`; resolved: replacing a single optional Folder assignment is idempotent and distinct from capture-time filing.
- Saved Item responses always include `folder` as a nullable **Folder Summary**; resolved: clients receive a stable response shape while older deployed clients safely ignore the additive field.
- **Folder Read Access** exposes only Folder identifiers and names; resolved: API clients discover destinations without gaining partial Library browsing data.
- Capture-time Folder assignment requires `saved-items:capture`, not **Folder Read Access**; resolved: clients may use a deliberately configured destination without enumerating Folders.
- Capture remains backward-compatible for clients that do not send a Folder identifier; resolved: their duplicate captures intentionally move the renewed Saved Item into **No Folder** under the new folder model.
- The behavioral change for older one-tap clients is accepted; resolved: preserving a single capture destination rule is preferred over retaining Folder membership on legacy recapture.
- Deleting a **Folder** must not delete **Saved Items**; resolved: items become unfoldered, and destructive UI must make that consequence explicit.
- Folder deletion confirmation describes only the direct Saved Item consequence; resolved: v1 does not attempt to warn about untracked external clients that may hold a deleted Folder identifier.
- Folder hierarchy is deferred; resolved: v1 **Folders** are flat because explicit single-folder filing does not require nested navigation or parent-child behavior.
- Saved Items without a **Folder** are surfaced through the **No Folder Filter** state; resolved: this is API and Library-home behavior, not a special Folder, named product destination, or the **Inbox**.
- Folder organization does not add filing UI to ordinary first-party capture flows; resolved: **One-Tap Capture** remains frictionless, while explicitly configured API clients may assign a Folder during capture.
- Initial folder movement is single-item only; resolved: the **Web Companion** supports drag-and-drop plus a non-drag move action, while the **Native iOS App** uses native move interaction, without requiring bulk filing in v1.
- Folders are navigation, not ordinary filters; resolved: a user enters a **Folder View**, then may use Library filters such as **Type** or **Tag** within it.
- Web Folder Views use path-based navigation; resolved: `/library/folders/{id}` represents a destination, while `/library` is the unfiled Library home.
- iOS Folder Views use native stack navigation; resolved: selecting a Folder pushes a destination view with a back path to the Library overview.
- Folder management stays beside navigation; resolved: web uses the Library sidebar with contextual menus, while iOS uses a horizontal Library Folder section with native context menus.
- Product Library roots represent Saved Items without a Folder without labeling that state **No Folder**; resolved: web and iOS show Folder destinations above or beside the unfiled Library home, while the API retains the explicit `folder=none` selector.
- The iOS Library root does not duplicate filed Saved Items; resolved: its item list contains only content without a Folder, so moving an item into a Folder visibly moves it to that destination.
- The Web Companion Library root matches iOS; resolved: `/library` contains unfiled Saved Items and user-created Folder navigation, while filed items are shown in `/library/folders/{id}`.
- Folder membership does not limit global search; resolved: the **Search Tab** and **Command Palette** retrieve across all Folders and unfiled content.
- Folder navigation is backed by the server-side **Folder Selector**; resolved: Folder Views do not require loading and filtering the complete Library on the client.
- **Folder Views** retain read items; resolved: Folders support durable retrieval rather than unread triage like the **Inbox**.
- **Folder** names must be unique within an **Account** after name normalization; resolved: navigation destinations remain distinguishable and renaming never implicitly merges content.
- Duplicate normalized Folder names return HTTP 409; resolved: the name is valid in form but conflicts with an existing Folder resource.
- Invalid Folder names return HTTP 400; resolved: clients may validate eagerly, while the REST API remains the validation authority.
- Folder name validation is shared across clients and API; resolved: trim stored names, reject blank names, and cap them at 80 characters for navigational display.
- Folder ordering is alphabetical in v1; resolved: user-created Folders are stable navigation destinations, while unfiled items remain on the Library root and custom ordering is deferred.
- API clients do not manage folder structure implicitly; resolved: folder management endpoints are reusable by any client, but API clients require `folders:read`, `folders:write`, or `folders:delete` for their corresponding operations.
- Folder organization uses shared REST **Folder Endpoints**; resolved: web and iOS consume the same API surface, while authorization still constrains external clients to granted operations.
- Folder delivery is dependency-ordered; resolved: implement the complete API and contract slice first, then implement the Web Companion and Native iOS App consumers one at a time against that API.
- Newest-first ordering uses **Last Saved At**; resolved: metadata updates should not reshuffle the queue.
- **Source** is not a **Capture Channel**; resolved: Source is a device/environment recall cue (e.g. "Onno's iPhone"), Capture Channel is the mechanism (e.g. `ios-share-extension`). Both are stored on each Saved Item.
- **Source** is lazily registered via the capture endpoint, not eagerly; resolved: the API finds-or-creates a Source by name within the Account when a `sourceName` is provided.
- **Source** is deduplicated by name within an Account; resolved: reinstalls or re-setups reuse the existing Source if the auto-detected name matches.
- **Source** is nullable; resolved: old items and raw API captures without a source name have no Source.
- An **Account** is not a **Public Profile**; resolved: Account stays the private owner and keeps avoiding the word profile, while a Public Profile is a separate audience-facing surface an Account may publish.
- A **Handle** is not a sign-in name; resolved: it is a product identifier stored with the Public Profile rather than an authentication credential.
- Publishing is per **Folder**, and there is no per-item publishing; resolved: an Account publishes a Folder and everything inside it appears, because one audience decision per Folder is a thing a person can hold in their head, while a rule that publishes everything except marked exceptions asks them to audit a whole library.
- A **Saved Item** carries no audience flag of its own; resolved: its Folder decides, so there is one place to look and one place to change.
- **Reading Activity** is saves, not reads; resolved: **Read State** stays private and no read-derived statistic appears on a Public Profile.
- **Reading Activity** is bucketed by creation time, not **Last Saved At**; resolved: a **Duplicate Save** would otherwise rewrite past activity.
- **Reading Activity** day buckets use UTC, not the viewer timezone; resolved: per-viewer bucketing would make every response unique and prevent shared caching.
- **Reading Activity** counts saves outside a **Published Folder**; resolved: a count is not a URL, and a grid restricted to published Saved Items would be too empty to be worth showing.
- Public Saved Item responses are not the Saved Item REST representation; resolved: the public shape is an allow-list, so fields added to the private representation later cannot leak.
- A public Saved Item page is not ordered by **Last Saved At**; resolved: Saved Item creation time orders it, so a **Duplicate Save** cannot reorder a published page.
- A public Saved Item page is not addressed by cursor; resolved: numbered pages give every page a shareable URL, which a crawler can reach and infinite scroll cannot.
- The first publish has no review step; resolved: opt-in confirmation copy states the item count and the automatic future behavior, and Sleevy accepts that an existing library publishes in full at that moment.
- **Readable Content** is not an archive; resolved: Sleevy stores the article prose only, while Shiori's WARC page copy and EPUB export are deliberately not adopted, which is what lets a **Link** still be said to retain what a page said rather than the page (see ADR 0021).
- **Readable Content** keeps two forms like Shiori, but a different pair and a different contract; resolved: Shiori stores plain text for search beside sanitized HTML for rendering and serves both, while Sleevy stores the extractor's article HTML beside Markdown, renders and indexes only the Markdown, and never serves the HTML.
- The HTML form is kept even though nothing reads it; resolved: converting to Markdown is lossy and one-way, and re-fetching a page months later to recover a table or a code block is not a plan, because the page may be paywalled, rewritten, or gone.
- Serving the HTML form is deferred, not designed out; resolved: the day the **Reader View** renders it, Sleevy must sanitize third-party markup on both clients, and that cost is taken on deliberately rather than inherited by accident.
- **Readable Content** is not extracted by Cloudflare; resolved: Cloudflare Browser Rendering supplies markup for pages the origin host cannot fetch, which on a blocklisted host is a large share of ordinary articles, but the article is always chosen by the local extractor. Cloudflare's Markdown endpoint converts a whole page rather than extracting an article, so it is not used at all (see ADR 0021).
- **Readable Content** does not live on **Link Metadata**; resolved: every list read joins that record per row, so a body column would be carried by every Library, Inbox, Folder View, and search read to serve a view that opens one item at a time.
- **Readable Content** does not repeat the **Preview Summary**'s role; resolved: a Preview Summary decides whether to open a Saved Item, while Readable Content is what is read after opening it.
- **Readable Content** is not searched in v1 even though it is indexed; resolved: the index cannot be added later without rewriting the table, while the query can be changed at any time, and whether an article's body should rank beside its title is a product question this change does not answer.
- **Readable Content** is not re-extracted when the local extractor finds no article; resolved: re-rendering such a page recovered nothing measurable, and the **Reader View** already falls back to the **Original URL**, which is the same posture Shiori takes minus its page archive (see ADR 0021).
- **Readable Content** is not re-extracted for existing **Links** in this change; resolved: it is written once per Link, and a backfill is a later operational concern rather than a product behavior.
- "Reading Queue" named the pre-Inbox home list of all Saved Items, and later specs and iOS code reused it for the unread-only surface; resolved: **Inbox** is the canonical name for the unread triage surface and the **Library** for the complete collection, so Reading Queue and Queue Tab are retired (see ADR 0019).
