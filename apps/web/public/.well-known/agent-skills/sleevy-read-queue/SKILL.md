# Read the Sleevy queue

Sleevy is one person's read-later queue. This skill covers reading what is in it
and tracking what they have got through.

## When to use this

The user asks what is in their reading list, wants to find a link they saved,
wants a question answered from saved reading, or wants something marked read or
unread.

Sleevy searches only the Readable Content it extracted from saved links. Do not
use it as a source for pages the user has not saved.

## Connect

Streamable HTTP MCP endpoint: `https://api.sleevy.app/mcp`. Reading needs
`saved-items:read`; changing read state needs `saved-items:write`.

## List what is saved

Call `list_saved_items`. Results come newest first and are **paged**:

- Pass `limit` for the page size, capped at 100.
- The response carries `nextCursor`. Call again with it until it comes back
  `null`.
- Treat the cursor as opaque. Pass it back exactly as given; never build one.
- A cursor belongs to the query that produced it — the same `sort` and folder
  filter.

Over REST the same shape lives at `GET /v1/saved-items?limit=50&cursor=...`.

## Find something specific

Call `search_saved_content` with a natural-language question or search phrase.
It combines keyword and semantic search and returns relevant passages with their
section and original URL. Base an answer on those excerpts, cite the URLs, and
say when the results do not provide enough evidence. Reading and search both use
the `saved-items:read` scope.

Use `list_saved_items` when the user wants the queue itself rather than an answer
from article content.

## Mark things read

`set_saved_item_read_state` takes a saved-item ID and a boolean. It is
idempotent — marking an already-read item read again succeeds and changes
nothing.

Over REST there is also `POST /v1/saved-items/{id}/open`, which records that the
person actually opened the link as well as marking it read. Prefer it when they
followed the link rather than just dismissing it.

## Working with IDs

Reuse the IDs Sleevy returns. They are stable. Never guess one — list first.

## Pacing

Every response carries `RateLimit-Limit`, `RateLimit-Remaining`, and
`RateLimit-Reset`. Slow down before you are refused rather than after. A `429`
carries `Retry-After`.
