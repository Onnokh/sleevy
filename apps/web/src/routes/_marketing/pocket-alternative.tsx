            "Pocket was rarely the destination. It was the small pause between finding something interesting and deciding whether it deserved your attention. The link left a crowded browser, landed somewhere dependable, and stopped asking for an immediate decision.",

            "It is worth asking two plain questions: can I save a link where I naturally find it, and can I find it again from where I naturally return to it? Those answers matter more than a long comparison table.",
            "If everything stays inside one browser ecosystem, its native Reading List may already be enough. Sleevy is useful when the same queue needs to cross iPhone, Chrome, Raycast, the web, and your own automations.",

            "Sleevy is deliberately focused on that handoff. A link can arrive from the iPhone Share sheet, the Chrome extension, Raycast, or a small script. It becomes part of the same personal queue rather than a separate pile for each device.",
            "When you come back, the point is not to manufacture a reading ritual. It is simply to search the queue, filter what matters, and open the original page when you are ready to give it attention.",

          title: "Choose the shape of the tool, not the loudest replacement",

            "Sleevy makes sense when your saved links need to move with you: from a phone to a browser, from a browser to the keyboard, or from a quick automation back to a single queue. It is a useful fit for people who want their reading list to feel like a lightweight memory rather than another project to maintain.",
            "If your workflow depends on a dedicated offline article reader or extensive annotation tools, choose a service that treats those as first-class concerns. A calm link queue is valuable, but it should not pretend to be every kind of reading tool.",
            "Pocket is also not the only read-it-later app people are replacing: Omnivore closed in 2024, and anyone weighing the remaining alternatives is choosing between a reader, an organizer, and a capture-first queue. That comparison is worth reading before you move a whole collection.",
