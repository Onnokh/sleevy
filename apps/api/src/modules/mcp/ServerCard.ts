 * The MCP Server Card body.

 * A card is read before a transport is opened, so it lists every tool the
 * server can expose, from the same catalogue `registerTools` registers from.
 * Which of those a given session actually sees depends on the scopes it was
 * granted, which is why each tool names the scopes that unlock it.
 *
 * This lives apart from the route so the card the API serves and the copy
 * published under the web origin's well-known namespace are built from one
 * definition and cannot describe different servers.
