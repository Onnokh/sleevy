        ## Why it matters

        The habit is easy to describe and hard to keep: save the thing you
        meant to read, then actually read it. Everything else in a reading
        list is in service of that one loop.

        - Save it where you are, not where the article is.
        - Let the list tell you what is still waiting.
        - Read it without the page arguing for your attention.

        > The best reading list is the one you come back to.

        ## In practice

        Most tools stop at the first step. The save is instant, the list grows,
        and the reading never happens, because opening an item means opening a
        browser tab and everything a browser tab brings with it.

        Reading in place changes the arithmetic. There is one column of text,
        the typography is yours, and the only thing on screen is the thing you
        saved.

        ## On a larger display

        A wider pane is not a wider column. Prose set across the full width of
        an unfolded display runs past the point where the eye can find the
        start of the next line, so the column keeps its measure and the space
        left over goes to the Article Outline instead.

        The outline is read out of the article itself, so it says what the
        writer wrote rather than what a heuristic guessed.

        ## What you give up

        Nothing you cannot take back. The Original URL is one tap away in the
        menu, and an extraction that lost the part you wanted is never a dead
        end — the page is still the page.

        Turn the Reader View off in Settings and every Saved Item goes
        straight out to its Original URL again, exactly as it did before.

        ## Saving from anywhere

        The share sheet, the browser extension, a shortcut on the Home Screen:
        each one is a door into the same list, and none of them asks you to
        decide anything at the moment of saving.

        ## Folders without filing

        A folder is somewhere to put the things you will come back to on
        purpose. The rest can stay in the Library, where search finds them.

        ## Search that remembers

        You rarely remember a title. You remember that it was about espresso,
        or that a mathematician said something about old problems. Search
        reads the article, not only the headline.

        ## Reading on the go

        A train has two minutes of signal between stations. The article should
        already be there when you open it, not be on its way.

        ## Reading at a desk

        On a wide screen the list stays beside the article, so finishing one
        and starting the next is a tap rather than a trip back.

        ## Typography

        One typeface, a comfortable size, and lines short enough to follow. A
        reading surface should be the article and nothing else.

        ## Long reads

        The outline is what makes a long article manageable: where you are,
        how much is left, and a way back to the part you wanted to quote.

        ## Sharing what you read

        A link is the best thing to send. The person you send it to gets the
        page as its writer made it.

        ## Clearing the list

        Read State is the only bookkeeping. An article you have opened is read;
        the list keeps it, and the Inbox lets it go.

        ## What comes next

        The loop stays the same: save it, find it, read it. Everything else is
        in service of that.
